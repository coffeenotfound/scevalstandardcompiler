# Sceval Standard Compiler

The Sceval Standard Compiler (SSC) is the reference toolchain for compiling and debugging the [Sceval language](https://github.com/coffeenotfound/sceval-spec). SSC is Java-based and compiles Sceval into JVM bytecode, executable with the JRE.

Developement of the Sceval Standard Compiler will start once the [Sceval spec](https://github.com/coffeenotfound/sceval-spec) is nearing completion.
